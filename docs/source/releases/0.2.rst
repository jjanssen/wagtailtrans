-----------
What is new
-----------

This release is a new major since it will only support Wagtail 1.12 and up. 
By dropping support for < 1.11 we are keeping inline with Wagtails own `release schedule <http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.12.1/releases/upgrading.html#version-numbers>`_.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Dropped support for Wagtail versions earlier than 1.12
- Custom ``get_admin_display_title`` method now uses Wagtails ``draft_title``

------------------------------
Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

This release drops support for Wagtail versions below 1.12.

- References to ``WAGTAILTRANS_TEMPLATE_DIR`` can be cleaned up since it was a requirement prior to Wagtail 1.8
